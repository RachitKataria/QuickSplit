You’re at dinner with your friends, and none of them brought their card but you. Or you guys went on a road trip, and your friend asks you to pick up some marshmallows from the gas station. In the end, you’ve got a lot of receipts. How do you split the costs evenly?

Splitting the bill has never been easier with QuickSplit. Take a picture of your receipt, and attach people to certain items. In the end there’s just one number which you will Venmo request for each friend. Never lose money again because people are too lazy to calculate their bill.
